## Docker

### Docker Compose

The reference [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml) defaults to use opensearch as the search engine.

Review our [Docker Install Guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker) for additional assistance.

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker compose up
```

This compose file includes a number of profiles that you can use to enable various optional services. The profiles are:

* **caddy** - This profile enables a Caddy service that is configured to proxy to FusionAuth on ports 80 and 443.
* **mailcatcher** - This profile enables Mailcatcher, which is a test SMTP server. You can configure FusionAuth to use this SMTP server during development and testing.
* **kafka** - This profile enables Kafka (and Zookeeper) which you can use Kafka to receive Webhook events.
* **cleanspeak** - This profile enables Cleanspeak, which you can use to filter usernames and profile data for profanity and other unwanted content.

To enable a profile, you use the `--profile` switch on the command-line like this (use can use multiple instances of this switch to enable multiple profiles):

```bash
docker compose --profile caddy --profile kafka up
```

### Docker Images
